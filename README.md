# sharp_s2_system_image

Here maintains the stock 8.0 `/system` image of SHARP AQUOS S2 and had been purified to eliminate most of the bloatwares. The first imported image is `dd`-ed from my SS2 right after the updating from 1.35F to 2.080WW.

The project uses `git-lfs` to commit `/root/system/app/Chrome/Chrome.apk` for github.com's 100MB file size limitation. You will need to have `git-lfs` installed to be able to checkout the repository.
